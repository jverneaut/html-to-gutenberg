# Overriding the files generated by HTML To Gutenberg

By default, HTML To Gutenberg automatically generates the following files for each block found in your input directory:

- `index.js`
- `edit.js`
- `block.json`
- `render.php`

However, you can override any of these files by simply placing specially named files alongside the corresponding `.html` source file.

**To override a file, create a new file with the following format:**

```txt
[block-slug].[filename].[extension]
```

For example, if you have a block defined in `blocks/hero.html`, you can override its generated `render.php` file by creating:

```txt
blocks/hero.render.php
```

Similarly, you can override:

```txt
blocks/hero.index.js
blocks/hero.edit.js
blocks/hero.block.json
```

These files will be copied **as-is** into the block's output folder and will not be overwritten by the generator.

In the future, youâ€™ll also be able to use this override system to provide editor and frontend specific styles and scripts.
These features are not implemented yet, but this flexible naming convention is designed to support them seamlessly.
