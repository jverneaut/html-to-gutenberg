# Different markup on the frontend and in the editor

To render and element based on the block context (frontend or editor), use the `data-display` attribute.

Supported values are:

- `frontend`: Only render this element on the frontend
- `editor`: Only render this element in the editor
- `selected`: Only render this element in the editor when the block is selected
- `unselected`: Only render this element in the editor when the block is not selected

  ```
  <section>
    <div>Visible everywhere</div>
    <div data-display="frontend">Visible on the frontend only</div>
    <div data-display="editor">Visible in the editor only</div>
    <div data-display="selected">
      Visible in the editor when the block is selected only
