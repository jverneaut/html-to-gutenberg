# Controlling block elements visibility

Use the `data-display` attribute to control when a specific element should be visible whether on the frontend, in the editor, or under certain editor conditions.

Supported values are:

- `frontend`: Renders only on the frontend
- `editor`: Renders only in the editor (regardless of block selection)
- `selected`: Renders only when the block is selected in the editor
- `not-selected`: Renders only when the block is not selected in the editor

<CodeExample filenmae="block-with-styles.html">
  ```
  <section>
    <div>Visible everywhere</div>
    <div data-display="frontend">Visible on the frontend only</div>
    <div data-display="editor">Visible in the editor only</div>
    <div data-display="selected">
      Visible in the editor when the block is selected only
    </div>
    <div data-display="not-selected">
      Visible in the editor when the block is not selected only
    </div>
  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>
