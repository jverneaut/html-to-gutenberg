# Defining parents

When working with innerBlocks, it can be usefull to define a child/parent relationship between you're block to prevent from being used where they shouldn't and from apearing on the Blocks navigator.

To do so, set the `data-parent` attribute on the block root element to a space seperated list of blocks.

<CodeExample filename="child-block.html">
  ```
  <section data-parent="core/group custom/parent-block"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>
