# Manually setting the block informations (name, title, etc.)

Behing the scenes, **HTML To Gutenberg** tries to do as much as possible for you, and tries to use reasonable defaults wherever possible instead of having to explicitely define those values.

One such case is the block's `name` attribute, which is automatically set based on the `blocksPrefix` option as well as the block filename.

Those attributes are still manually modifiable if needed.
