# Manually setting the block informations (name, title, etc.)

Behing the scenes, **HTML To Gutenberg** tries to do as much as possible for you, and tries to use reasonable defaults wherever possible instead of having to explicitely define those values.

One such case is the block's `name` attribute, which is automatically set based on the `defaultNamespace` option as well as the block filename.

Those attributes are still manually modifiable if needed.

## Changing the block name

To change the block name, use the `data-name` attribute on the root block element.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section data-name="custom-namespace/custom-block-name"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Changing the block title

To change the block title, use the `data-title` attribute on the root block element.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section data-title="Custom block title"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Setting the block description

To change the block description, use the `data-description` attribute on the root block element.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section data-description="Custom description"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Changing the block icon

To change the block icon, use the `data-icon` attribute on the root block element.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section data-icon="star"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Changing the block category

To change the block category, use the `data-category` attribute on the root block element.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section data-category="widgets"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>
