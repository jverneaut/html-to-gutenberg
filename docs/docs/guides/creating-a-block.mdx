# Creating a block

## With `@wordpress/create-block`

If you created your blocks plugin using `@wordpress/create-block` with the `html-to-gutenberg-template`, adding a new block is as simple as creating a new `.html` file inside the `src/` folder.

```txt
.
├── src/
│   ├── first-block.html
│   ├── second-block.html
│   └── ... # Add more blocks by adding files here
├── generated-blocks/
│   ├── first-block/
│   │   ├── block.json
│   │   ├── edit.js
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── render.php
│   └── second-block/
│       ├── block.json
│       ├── edit.js
│       ├── index.js
│       └── render.php
└── build/
    ├── first-block/
    │   └── ...
    └── second-block/
        └── ...
```

## With custom webpack config

If you've created a custom webpack configuration to build your blocks, you can add a new block by creating a new `.html` file inside the `options.inputDirectory` folder.

## Git ignore recommendation

If you're compiling blocks as part of a CI/CD pipeline, you can (and should) safely `.gitignore` the folder where your blocks are generated and the `dist` directory.

Add the following entries to your plugin’s `.gitignore` file:

```txt
generated-blocks # The folder where your blocks are generated
dist
```

This keeps your repository clean and avoids committing auto-generated code.
