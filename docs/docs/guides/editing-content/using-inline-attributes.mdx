# Using inline attributes

**HTML To Gutenberg** allows defining inline editable fields using the special `data-bind` attribute directly in your HTML template.

By default, it uses the `RichText` component for text-based elements. For images (`<img>`), it uses `Media` from `@wordpress/block-editor` along with `MediaUpload` from `@10up/block-components`, enabling image selection and editing.

<LiveEditor>
  ```
  <section>
    <h2 data-bind="title">Section Title</h2>
    <p data-bind="description">Section description</p>

    <img data-bind="image" />

  </section>
  ```
</LiveEditor>

## Making text editable

To make a text element editable in Gutenberg, add `data-bind="name"` to it — where name is the name of the attribute that will be saved by Gutenberg.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section>
    <h2 data-bind="title">Section Title</h2>
    <p data-bind="description">Section description</p>
  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

This will define a `title` and `description` attribute on your block.

If the element contains content, that content will be used as the default value for the attribute in `block.json`.

For example:

```html
<p data-bind="content"><strong>Default content</strong></p>
```

```json title="block.json"
{
  "attributes": {
    "content": {
      "type": "string",
      "default": "<strong>Default content</strong>"
    }
  }
}
```

On the editor side, a placeholder is automatically added to the `RichText` field based on the attribute name in sentence case (sectionTitle becomes Section title).

:::info Favor using InnerBlocks when possible
While inline attributes are handy for isolated text fields, they are limited to the tag you define. You can't insert additional elements inside or after them.

Prefer `<inner-blocks>` (InnerBlocks) when you want full control over headings, paragraphs, buttons, or flexible layout content.

It can be tempting to use this kind of inline editable fields for every text content inside your block.

## Making images editable

You can make images editable using the same principle: add `data-bind="name"` to an `<img>` element — where name is the attribute that will store the image ID.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section>
    <img data-bind="image" />
  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

The `src` and `alt` attributes will be removed automatically and replaced with correct values once an image is selected — no need to set them manually.

### Setting image size

To control which image size is used in the editor and frontend, use `data-image-size`:

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section>
    <img data-bind="image" data-image-size="medium" />
  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

- In the **editor**, the specified size is displayed.
- On the **frontend**, it's used with `srcset` for responsive behavior.

:::info Favor using InnerBlocks when possible
As with text fields, editable images with `data-bind` are limited in flexibility. For a richer, more native experience, use `<inner-blocks>` (InnerBlocks) with the `core/image` block.

Secondary note: images defined this way can only be selected or changed by clicking them in the editor. If they’re hidden with CSS, they won’t be editable.
