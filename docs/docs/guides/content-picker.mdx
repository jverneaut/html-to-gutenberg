# Using the ContentPicker component

**HTML To Gutenberg** supports integration with the `ContentPicker` component from [@10up/block-components](https://github.com/10up/block-components) through the custom element `<content-picker>`.

Currently, this component supports [data binding](data-binding.mdx) only to attributes via the `data-bind` attribute (e.g., `data-bind="attributeName"`). Additionally, you can control how many posts can be selected by setting the `max-content-items` attribute.

## Typical Use Case

A common scenario for using this component is to let editors select posts directly within the editor interface, and then render those posts server-side in your blockâ€™s `render.php` file using [file overrides](overrides.mdx).

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section>
    <inspector-controls>
      <panel-body title="Settings">
        <content-picker data-bind="posts"></content-picker>
      </panel-body>
    </inspector-controls>

    <server-block name="custom/posts-slider"></server-block>

  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>
