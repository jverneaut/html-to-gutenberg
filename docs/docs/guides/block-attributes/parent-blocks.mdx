# Defining parent blocks

When working with InnerBlocks, it’s useful to define parent-child relationships between blocks. This helps prevent child blocks from being used outside of their intended parents and hides them from the Blocks Navigator when not appropriate.

To specify the allowed parents for a block, set the `data-parent` attribute on the block’s root element. This attribute takes a space-separated list of parent block names.

<CodeExample filename="child-block.html">
  ```
  <section data-parent="core/group custom/parent-block"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>
