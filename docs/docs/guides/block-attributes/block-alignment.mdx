# Defining the block alignment

By default, **HTML To Gutebnerg** assumes your block supports the `"full"` alignment only.

If you want to override this behavior, use the `data-align` attribute on the root element. This attribute accepts a space-separated list of alignments with the first one being used as the default.

You can also opt-out of supporting the alignment attribute by setting `data-align` to `false`.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section data-align="full wide"></section>
  ```
</CodeExample>
