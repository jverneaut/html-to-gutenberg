# Introduction

After building custom Gutenberg blocks using React.js and PHP, I was frustrated by the development experience of having to duplicate work accross React and PHP, using the same classes, the same markup with some minor differences between thoses.

**HTML To Gutenberg** allows you to use a single HTML file to generate custom dynamic Gutenberg blocks. Using some magical HTML attributes ðŸª„, you can add **inline editable text and image fields** to your blocks, use **InnerBlocks** with custom templates, add additional **block styles** and much more â€“ all of this without writing a single line of React.js.

## Try it live

Want to see HTML to Gutenberg in action?

Try editing the `block.html` file below to see the changes reflected in real time.

<SideBySideEditor>
  ```
  <section class="py-20 bg-blue-200" data-parent="custom/parent-block" data-editing-mode="contentOnly">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="grid grid-cols-12 gap-4">
        <div class="col-span-12 md:col-span-6">
          <h2 class="text-2xl" data-attribute="section_title">I am editable â€“ awesome, right?</h2>
          <img class="aspect-square object-cover" data-attribute="section_image" />
        </div>

        <div class="col-span-12 md:col-span-6">
          <blocks allowedBlocks="all" templateLock="all">
            <block name="core/group">
              <block name="core/heading" level="3"></block>
              <block name="core/paragraph">
                <attribute name="content">
                  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
                </attribute>
              </block>
            </block>
          </blocks>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  </section>
  ```

## Quick start

### Scaffold a block plugin using @wordpress/create-block

Use the `@wordpress/create-block` CLI tool to scaffold a block using HTML To Gutenberg:

```bash
# Inside your wp-content/plugins directory
npx @wordpress/create-block --template html-to-gutenberg-template
```

This will create a new custom block plugin, install the required dependencies and setup HTML To Gutenberg for you.

### Build your block using HTML To Gutenberg

Next, `cd` into your newly created plugin and run:

```bash
# Inside your block plugin directory (eg. wp-content/plugins/my-awesome-block)
npm run start
```

### Use the generated block

Active your plugin in WordPress admin, you're ready to go!

Your block will be available in the editor and rendered on the frontend when added.

### Make changes to the block's HTML

To make changes to the block, modify `wp-content/plugins/{your-plugin-name}/src/block.html` while `npm run start` is running.

When you're ready for prime time, simply run `npm run build` inside your plugin directory to build the block for production.

## Features

- Inline editable elements
- InnerBlocks
- Block attributes

## Philosophy

- Compiles to native code rendering
- Single source of truth
- As close to native API as possible

## Comparison with other tools

- Comparison with native Gutenberg Block development

## Limitations

- WYSIWYG, so what you can't see you can't edit.
