**Create custom Gutenberg blocks from the HTML templates you already have.**

**HTML To Gutenberg** is a developer tool that transforms HTML files into fully functional Gutenberg blocks for WordPress. With just a few intuitive attributes in your markup, it generates the full block structure — including `edit.js`, `render.php`, `block.json`, and `index.js`.

It’s designed for developers who value simplicity, speed, and control — without sacrificing the native block editor experience.
