**HTML to Gutenberg** is a Webpack plugin that compiles your HTML into real, native Gutenberg blocks. No shortcodes. No server-side hacks. _The real Gutenberg editing experience._

It generates proper `edit.js`, `render.php`, `block.json`, and `index.js` files, exactly what you'd write by hand if you were building blocks with React and PHP.

**But you wonâ€™t have to write a single line of React or PHP.**

Just structure your HTML with a few intuitive attributes, and let the plugin handle the heavy lifting.

The output is 100% native Gutenberg code. If you stop using the plugin, your blocks still work. No lock-in.
