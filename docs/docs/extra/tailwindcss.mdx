# Styling Gutenberg Blocks with TailwindCSS

Blocks created using **HTML To Gutenberg** are just plain HTML files — which means **TailwindCSS works out of the box** with no extra configuration. This makes Tailwind a perfect choice for styling custom blocks: styles are scoped to each block and don’t require additional CSS files.

That said, Gutenberg comes with a few quirks — especially when using `InnerBlocks`. The editor adds wrapper elements, which can complicate styling.

Below are some snippets I use in every project to make working with Gutenberg and TailwindCSS smoother.

## Styling InnerBlocks with TailwindCSS

```css
@custom-variant wp-list-layout {
  &:not(:has(.block-editor-block-list__layout)) {
    @slot;
  }

  :has(.block-editor-block-list__layout) {
    .block-editor-block-list__layout {
      @slot;
    }
  }
}
```

This custom variant allows you to target layout wrappers injected by Gutenberg when using InnerBlocks and passing the styles as is on the frontend.

## Styling core blocks with TailwindCSS

### core/button

To style buttons in the editor and frontend consistently, I use the following selector to target both `core/button` and apply styles with TailwindCSS `@apply` directive:

```css
:root :where(.wp-element-button, .wp-block-button__link) {
  @apply ...;
}
```

When adding transitions (e.g. for label changes), the animation can be distracting in the editor. To prevent this, I use an exaggerated transition duration inside the editor iframe:

```css
.block-editor-iframe__html .wp-element-button,
.block-editor-iframe__html .wp-block-button__link {
  &,
  &::after,
  &::before,
  * {
    transition-duration: 999s;
  }
}
```

This effectively disables transitions while editing.

## Targeting Specific Blocks with Tailwind Variants

When working with InnerBlocks, it's often useful to apply styles to child blocks from their container.

To do that, create a `@custom-variant` for each block you want to target:

```css
/* Do this for each block you want to target */
@custom-variant wp-block-heading {
  .wp-block-heading {
    @slot;
  }
}

@custom-variant wp-block-group {
  .wp-block-group {
    @slot;
  }
}
```

You can now combine those variants with other Tailwind modifiers. For example, applying styles to only the first `core/heading` block inside a group:

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section class="py-20">
    <div class="wp-block-heading:first-of-type:text-red-600 wp-block-group:p-10">
      <inner-blocks templateLock="all">
        <inner-block name="core/group">
          <inner-block name="core/heading" content="I am red"></inner-block>
          <inner-block name="core/heading" content="I am not red"></inner-block>
        </inner-block>
      </inner-blocks>
    </div>
  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

:::info
I wish Tailwind supported dynamic variants, so we could avoid manually defining one for every block type — but as of TailwindCSS v4, this isn’t available.
