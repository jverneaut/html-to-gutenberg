# Installing HTML To Gutenberg

Ready to start building Gutenberg blocks at light speed? Here's how to get started with **HTML To Gutenberg**, whether you're spinning up a new project or integrating it into a custom Webpack setup.

## Basic – Using @wordpress/create-block (Recommended)

The fastest and most foolproof way to get started.

<QuickStart />

## Advanced – Manually adding HTML To Gutenberg to an existing webpack configuration

If you’re using Webpack to build your custom blocks, you can easily integrate **HTML To Gutenberg** into your build process to automatically generate `block.json`, `edit.js`, `render.php` and `index.js` from simple HTML files.

### Installation

```bash
npm install @jverneaut/html-to-gutenberg --save-dev
```

### Webpack configuration

Add the plugin to your existing Webpack configuration:

```js title="webpack.config.js"
import HTMLToGutenbergPlugin from "@jverneaut/html-to-gutenberg";

export default {
  plugins: [
    new HTMLToGutenbergPlugin({
      inputDirectory: "./blocks",
      outputDirectory: "./generated-blocks",
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### Plugin options

| Option                 | Type      | Default          | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputDirectory`       | `string`  | None             | Source folder for your custom blocks HTML files.                           |
| `outputDirectory?`     | `string`  | `inputDirectory` | Output folder that will contain the generated blocks files.                |
| `blocksPrefix?`        | `string`  | 'custom'         | Prefix used for block names (e.g., `custom/hero`).                         |
| `removeDeletedBlocks?` | `boolean` | `false`          | Whether to delete generated blocks if their source HTML files are removed. |

:::warning
This page walks you through how to configure it manually — but keep in mind that **HTML To Gutenberg is only responsible for generating the block files**, not for compiling or bundling them. If you are an advanced webpack user and already have a webpack config that can compile blocks, then adding HTML To Gutenberg can be as simple as adding the plugin to your configuration and poiting to its outputdirectory in your custom configuration. For every other use case, I highly recommend using the standard `@wordpress/create-block` approach.

If you still want to delve into building blocks manually, you should use well-supported tools like [`@wordpress/scripts`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-scripts/).

### Bundling blocks with @jvenreaut/gutenberg-webpack-plugin

To make integrating `@wordpress/scripts` easier into an existing webpack configuration, I created **[@jverneaut/gutenberg-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jverneaut/gutenberg-webpack-plugin)**. It’s heavily based on `@wordpress/scripts` and, while not 100% feature-complete, it makes bundling blocks much easier when using a custom Webpack setup.

It allows bundling blocks from inside your theme as opposed to a separate plugin, adding custom preprocessors using webpack, using TailwindCSS, etc.

#### Example config

```js title="webpack.config.js"
import HTMLToGutenbergPlugin from "@jverneaut/html-to-gutenberg";
import GutenbergWebpackPlugin from "@jverneaut/gutenberg-webpack-plugin";

export default {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./index.js", // Your main entry point for non-Gutenberg scripts

  plugins: [
    new HTMLToGutenbergPlugin({
      inputDirectory: "./blocks", // Source folder for your custom blocks HTML
      outputDirectory: "./generated-blocks", // Where transformed blocks will be output
    }),

    new GutenbergWebpackPlugin("./generated-blocks"), // Registers the generated blocks
  ],
};
```

When bundling blocks this way, don't forget to register them from the built output to make them available to WordPress. To learn how, head over to the next page.
