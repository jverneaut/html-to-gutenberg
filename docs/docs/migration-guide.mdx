HTML to Gutenberg v2.0.0 introduces a complete engine rewrite and a powerful new set of features enabling developers to build even more advanced editing experiences with Gutenberg.

## Replacing `data-attributes` with `data-bind`

As part of the core rewrite, the `data-attribute` attribute has been deprecated in favor of a new, more powerful API: `data-bind`.

While `data-attribute` was limited to binding block attributes, `data-bind` allows you to bind not only block attributes but also post meta and certain post-level attributes, like the post title.

Hereâ€™s what the new syntax looks like:

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section class="hero">
    <!-- Binding to the post title and custom post meta -->
    <h1 data-bind="post.title">Post title</h1>
    <p data-bind="postMeta.description">Custom post description meta</p>

    <!-- Equivalent, data-bind defaults to attributes.[key] -->
    <input type="text" data-bind="customAttributes">
    <input type="text" data-bind="attributes.customAttribute">

  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Replacing `<blocks>` and `<block>` with `<inner-blocks>` and `<inner-block>`

To unify the API and align more closely with Gutenberg conventions, some element names have been updated.

The `<blocks>` and `<block>` elements have been renamed to `<inner-blocks>` and `<inner-block>` respectively. These new names follow the convention of using hyphenated tag names, similar to how custom elements are defined in HTML.

As part of this, the `<blocks>` and `<block>` elements have been renamed to `<inner-blocks>` and `<inner-block>` respectively.

<CodeExample>
  ```
  <section>
    <inner-blocks>
      <inner-block name="custom/child-block"></inner-block>
    </inner-blocks>
  </section>
  ```
</CodeExample>

## Replacing `<attribute>` with `<block-attribute>`

As part of the API unification, the `<attribute>` element has been renamed to `<block-attribute>` for greater clarity and consistency.
